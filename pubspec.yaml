repository: https://github.com/deckerst/aves
version: 1.3.5+41
publish_to: none

environment:
  sdk: '>=2.10.0 <3.0.0'

# TODO TLAD merge null safe `expansion_tile_card` to fork
# TODO TLAD migrate from `flushbar` to basic SnackBar or `another_flushbar`
# TODO TLAD remove explicit `overlay_support` version when 1.2.0 is stable (1.0.5 uses deprecated `ancestorWidgetOfExactType`)

# TODO TLAD switch to Flutter dev/beta when possible, currently on master because of the following mess:
# printing >=5.0.1 depends on pdf ^3.0.1, pdf >=3.0.1 depends on crypto ^3.0.0 and archive ^3.1.0
# but `flutter_driver` (shipped with Flutter) dependencies are too old in stable v2.0.1
# bump `crypto` and others - 2021/02/05 https://github.com/flutter/flutter/commit/bc1cf4945841ba5874f5262b8146d52750e7c11f
# bump `archive` from 3.0.0 to 3.1.2 - 2021/03/04 https://github.com/flutter/flutter/commit/ddcb8d7d6d3fcedc906b2f1bf26b73c018d3dc28
