Aves is a gallery and metadata explorer app. It is built for Android, with Flutter.

## Features

Aves can handle all sorts of images and videos, including your typical JPEGs and MP4s, but also more exotic things like **multi-page TIFFs, SVGs, old AVIs and more**!

It scans your media collection to identify **motion photos**, **panoramas** (aka photo spheres), **360Â° videos**, as well as **GeoTIFF** files.

**Navigation and search** is an important part of Aves. The goal is for users to easily flow from albums to photos to tags to maps, etc.

Aves integrates with Android (from **API 20 to 31**, i.e. from Lollipop to S) with features such as **app shortcuts** and **global search** handling. It also works as a **media viewer and picker**.

## Permissions

Aves requires a few permissions to do its job:
- **read contents of shared storage**: the app only accesses media files, and modifying them requires explicit access grants from the user,
- **read locations from media collection**: necessary to display the media coordinates, and to group them by country (via reverse geocoding),
- **have network access**: necessary for the map view, and most likely for precise reverse geocoding too,
- **view network connections**: checking for connection states allows Aves to gracefully degrade features that depend on internet.

## Project Setup

Create a file named `<app dir>/android/key.properties`. It should contain a reference to a keystore for app signing, and other necessary credentials. See `<app dir>/android/key_template.properties` for the expected keys.
